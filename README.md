Predicting saturated vapor pressure of LNG from density and temperature data 
The aim of the study is to predict saturated vapor pressure (SVP) of LNG from various sources (different compositions) using temperature and pressure data for better tank pressure management. This is crucial as it is very difficult to use detailed thermodynamic relationships to determine saturated vapor pressure in dynamic conditions, especially due to various possible compositions. This temperature, pressure and SVP data was generated using Aspen HYSYS, a chemical process simulation software. The temperature range and the different compositions for different sources of LNG are taken in accordance with the reference paper. The framework that weâ€™ve built predicts SVP in the tank, irrespective of the composition, and thus the application of the framework extends to cases with LNG from any source.
